# DATS6101_Project
Seattle Area Housing Market

This is a team repository for a housing market prediction model for the Seattle area based on the kc_house_data.csv dataset, retrieved on kaggle.com. Our initial EDA and visualization section can be found in the Project 1 folder, while use of regression models can be found in the Project 2 folder.
We recommend patience in running Project 2 code, given the few minutes Random Forest usually takes to run.
